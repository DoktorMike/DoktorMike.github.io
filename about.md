I'm just a technology driven artificial intelligence evangelist and machine learning enthusiast, trying to do my part in moving this world forward, one little baby step at a time.

### More Information

I started out building artificial neural networks for helping physicians detect acute coronary syndromes in the emergency departments in Swedish hospitals.

After that I spent a couple of years in the financial sector developing business intelligence software that allowed banks and asset management companies to calculate the amount of money they stood to lose on a given trading day.

The last 6 years I've been in the media and marketing industry developing and refining sales modeling and the use of Bayesian inference to quantify the effect different activities have on sales.
